    "<h1>Python Shopping Cart</h1> Develop a versatile shopping cart program with the following functionalities:\n",
    "Upon starting the program, initialize an empty list or dictionary to represent the shopping cart.<br>  Present a user-friendly menu that includes the following options:\n",
    "Allow users to add items to the shopping cart.<br>  For each item, prompt the user to input a name, quantity, and price. Store these details and add it to the shopping cart.<br> \n",
    "Provide the ability to remove items from the shopping cart.<br>  Prompt the user to input the name of the item they wish to remove.<br>  Ensure to handle cases where the item is not found in the cart.<br> \n",
    "Display the current contents of the shopping cart. Include the name, quantity, and price of each item, as well as a running total of the cost.\n",
    "Allow the user to exit the program. <br> Upon quitting, print a summary of all items in the cart, including their details and the total cost.\n",
    "Implement a loop that continuously prompts the user for their choice until they decide to quit.<br> \n",
    "Include appropriate error handling to deal with scenarios such as invalid input when adding or removing items.<br> \n",
    "Ensure that the program provides a clear and user-friendly experience. Include informative messages and prompts to guide the user through each step.<br> \n",
    "After the user quits, display a friendly closing message along with the final list of items in the cart and the total cost."
